# How to run tests.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Delete the db test.db in .\backend\services.

- First, run the train model tests.

    .\backend\services\train_model\app>poetry run pytest

This will create the db test.db in .\backend\services.

- Then, run the forecast tests.

    .\backend\services\forecast\app>poetry run pytest

If you want to run the forecast tests several times, do not delete the db test.db.

If running the train tests again, first delete the db test.db in .\backend\services.
